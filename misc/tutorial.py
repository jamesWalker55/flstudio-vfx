# Since we are generating voices in this case (rather than modifying voices), we
# don't need onTriggerVoice() and onReleaseVoice() calls. Most of the work is
# done during the onTick() call, where we'll use vfx.context.ticks and
# vfx.context.PPQ to see what the clock time is, and if a voice should be
# generated on that tick.
def onTick():
    # Get parameters from UI controls:
    note_number = vfx.context.form.getInputValue("Note Number")
    note_period = pow(2, vfx.context.form.getInputValue("Period") - 1)
    note_length = vfx.context.form.getInputValue("Length")
    note_pan = vfx.context.form.getInputValue("Pan")
    note_velocity = vfx.context.form.getInputValue("Velocity")
    # Set period between voice generations (PPQ = ticks/quarter note)
    stepTicks = int(note_period * vfx.context.PPQ / 2)  # Time between notes in ticks
    if vfx.context.isPlaying and vfx.context.ticks % stepTicks == 1:
        v = vfx.Voice()  # Create new voice
        v.note = note_number  # Set pitch via note number
        v.length = int(note_length * stepTicks)  # Set note length in ticks
        v.pan = note_pan  # Set voice pan
        v.velocity = note_velocity  # Set voice velocity
        v.trigger()  # Trigger the voice


# Note that since we are generating voices and setting their length at trigger
# time, we don't need to manually release them; they will be release automatically
# at v.length ticks after triggering.


# We create the needed UI controls in the createDialog() call:
